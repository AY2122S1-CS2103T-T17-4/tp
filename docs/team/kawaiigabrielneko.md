### Project: InsurancePal

InsurancePal is a client management software specially designed to help manage the logistics of being an insurance agent.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added insurances.
  * What it does: Allows the user keep track of all insurances held by each client in the address book.
  * Justification: It is important for an insurance agent to know what insurance policies each of their clients have. 
  * Highlights: Insurances are classified into three types, Life insurance, Health insurance, and General insurance, 
      and can have a brand name attached to it.
